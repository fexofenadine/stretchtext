Just an HTML webpage that in very large letters tells the visitor to "GET OUT".

Uses Javascript & CSS to embiggen the text, based on the size of the browser window.

There's a tiny bit of flair on the text to give it a stroke depth, and the background image will stretch horizontally or vertically til whichever dimension fills the window first.
